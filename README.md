# BPL-DataVault


As part of CSE302 (Database Systems) project at East West University, our team developed BPL DataVault – A Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) Database Management System 🎯.

We have collected real-time data from CricSheet. They provides all types of Cricket tournaments dataset in JSON file. We converted that into CSV formatted file and loaded into Oracle Apex database.


🔹 What it does:
 BPL DataVault is a comprehensive cricket database system built to efficiently store, manage, and analyze detailed BPL 2024/25 data. It covers matches, players, teams, venues, umpires, and ball-by-ball events—providing meaningful insights into player and team performance.
 
🔹 Key Features:

 ✅ Structured database design with proper normalization (1NF → BCNF)
 
 ✅ Implementation in Oracle APEX, with 51 interactive pages & role-based access
 
 ✅ 34 Reports with forms, 13 aggregate query-based reports, and 9 charts/graphs
 
 ✅ SQL queries to analyze player stats, team performance, and match outcomes
 
 ✅ Role-based authentication (Admin, Contributor, Reader)
 
 ✅ Visual dashboards and performance statistics

 
🔹 Why this project matters:
 Managing and analyzing cricket data like BPL involves massive volumes of player stats and ball-by-ball records. Our system ensures accurate storage, retrieval, and meaningful analysis, laying a strong foundation for future sports analytics and live-data integration.

And special gratitude to our course instructor Sanzana Karim Lora ma'am for guidance throughout this journey.



💡 Future Scope:
 We aim to expand the system to analyze all seasons in BPL.
 
This project was an incredible learning journey—strengthening our technical, analytical, and problem-solving skills in Database Systems.
